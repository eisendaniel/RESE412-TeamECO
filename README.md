# RESE412-TeamECO

Remote Control Car Charge Station Project

## To do list

### - Sensor attachment

- Getting datasheets and configuring/soldering the current sensor (hall effect sensor) and proximity sensor
- Configuring Arduino to revise testing data

### - Motor testing: 

- Test the current draw of each motor (including straight line, turning and turf terrain)
- Test the speed of motor using proximity sensor

### - Battery dissipation and generation

- Testing the rates at which the different batteries dissipates at (seeing if there is linear or non linear dissipation) 
- Testing the rates at which the different batteries generate at (seeing if there is linear or non linear generation)

### - Solar panel generation 

- Testing monocrystalline solar panel generation
- Testing polycrystalline solar panel generation
- Comparing price to power generation for mono and polycrystalline
- Testing flexy panels

### - Miscellaneous (maybe not needed)

- Forecast check for race day
- Testing the RC car as RWD
